## DIMet: Differential Isotope-labeled targeted Metabolomics
----------------------------
**DIMet** is a bioinformatics pipeline for differential analysis of isotopic targeted labeling data.

Closely related to conventional metabolomics, stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM) uses an isotope labeled substrate to track specific pathways. From these data, it is possible to compute differences in isotope enrichment, changes in the labeling pattern, or differences in the contribution of nutrients to a metabolite pool, yielding knowledge of the metabolic state [1, 2]. Targeted metabolomics, when combined to transcriptomics, allows to better characterize perturbations within the pathways of interest.  

DIMet supports the analysis of full metabolite abundances and isotopologue contributions, and allows to perform it either in the differential comparison mode or as a time-series analysis. As input, the DIMet accepts three types of measures: a) isotopologues’ contributions, b) fractional contributions, c) full metabolites’ abundances. Specific functions process each of the three types of measures separately:
