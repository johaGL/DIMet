This example folder provides examples of datasets:

Copy and them in your 'home/'

For example, for running toy0, in your home, type:

```
conda activate dimet
python -m DIMet.src.prepare $HOME/toy0/analysis001/config-0-001.yml
```

The 'toy_metabologram' reuses the toy2 data, but has only 
selected results (also modified to produce better plots, as demo)
for running the metabologram.
