ALERT! when finished the fitting part improvements, re-integrate the univariate tests . == DONE

bug when running prepare in example2 dataset, function calculate_meanEnri in loop for met__i in metabolites

!! 17 02 2023 :
config that I used to put in pycharm:
--mode diffabund --mywdir ~/myelin_metabo --config ~/myelin_metabo/configs/cmyelin_disfit-1.yml --isotoAbsolutes_zero_replace min/1.01 --padj 0.8

things are going to change deeply, from now


--------
config :

data is data as received !

tmp no, instead 'prepared'

extrulist : "mets_toexclude" : make this a advanced-optional option !

for lineplots fracccontrib: give as many colors (automatic) as metabolites :)
make the linees plus epaisses

also_total_marked : "N" no by default , BETTER MAKE IT AS ADVANCED-optional OPTION!

- PREP DANGER !! 
  # both abus and isotopologues ???? :

    parser.add_argument("--amountMaterial", default=None, type=str,
                        help="path to a .tsv file containing the amount of material (number of cells, mg tissue) by sample.\
                         The abundances will be divided by these values (sample specific)")
                         
                         is this to absolute isotopologues as well ??



- diff:
change the behaviour, no longer use values * proportions to yield
those ugly difficult to anlyse isotopologue values.
 grep abufrom *.py
abundances_bars.py:This script exploits species and compartment specific tables at 'data/abufromperc/'
functions_diffmode.py:    abunda_species_4diff_dir = dirtmpdata + "abufromperc/"
__init__.py:abunda_species_4diff_dir = dirtmpdata + "abufromperc/"
