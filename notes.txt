ALERT! when finished the fitting part improvements, re-integrate the univariate tests . == DONE

bug when running prepare in example2 dataset, function calculate_meanEnri in loop for met__i in metabolites

!! 17 02 2023 :
config that I used to put in pycharm:
--mode diffabund --mywdir ~/myelin_metabo --config ~/myelin_metabo/configs/cmyelin_disfit-1.yml --isotoAbsolutes_zero_replace min/1.01 --padj 0.8

things are going to change deeply, from now


--------
config :

data is data as received !

tmp no, instead 'prepared'

extrulist : "mets_toexclude" : make this a advanced-optional option !

for lineplots fracccontrib: give as many colors (automatic) as metabolites :)
make the linees plus epaisses

also_total_marked : "N" no by default , BETTER MAKE IT AS ADVANCED-optional OPTION!




- diff:
change the behaviour, no longer use values * proportions to yield
those ugly difficult to anlyse isotopologue values.
 grep abufrom *.py
abundances_bars.py:This script exploits species and compartment specific tables at 'data/abufromperc/'
functions_diffmode.py:    abunda_species_4diff_dir = dirtmpdata + "abufromperc/"
__init__.py:abunda_species_4diff_dir = dirtmpdata + "abufromperc/"
